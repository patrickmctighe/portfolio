<p>To whom it may concern,

 
<p>It is my pleasure to write this letter of recommendation for Patrick McTighe. My name is Matthew Dawes, and I am the Chef and owner of The Bull and Beggar in Asheville North Carolina. 
      I have come to know Patrick while working with him for the last eight years.  He has proven himself among the most capable apprentices I have had the pleasure to work with in my twenty-year career.
       I mean this both in respect to his creative intelligence, and in his considerable skill level.
</p>

 
<p>All told, Patrick is highly skilled at problem-solving and displays a huge potential for leadership, among other highly commendable traits.  
    He has repeatedly demonstrated his ability to master difficult techniques, to succeed in high pressure situations, and to lead a team at a level that often exceeds expectations.
      Since starting at the restaurant, Patrick has advanced his knowledge of baking and pastry and has progressed to the rank of Pastry Chef for two of our restaurants. 
       After taking the position of Pastry Chef, sales of desserts doubled and have maintained that increase ever since. 
</p>

 
<p>As well as being familiar with Patrick’s professional accomplishments, I believe I am also uniquely capable of testifying to Patrick’s personality and character.
      We have worked closely together over his time at the restaurant.  Knowing him as I do, I aggressively endorse Patrick as a candidate for employment in your organization.
</p>

 
<p>It is notable that soon after starting, Patrick set himself apart from other kitchen apprentices by demonstrating an impressive ability to master complex 
    techniques that often take years for others to accomplish.  It also became clear that he performs well under pressure, and that he possesses a highly evolved palate. 
     Patrick was able to master every station on our line and soon began managing our popular brunch service.  This allowed Patrick to demonstrate his ability to handle 
     administrative duties such as ordering, scheduling, and time management. Later as Pastry Chef, Patrick was further able to cultivate these skills and was left to manage 
     himself and the program in its entirety.  The quality at which he achieved in these duties rapidly earned Patrick the respect of his cohorts at both restaurants.  
     Most key to Patrick’s success, he holds himself to a high professional standard.  I find this to be a rare and hugely beneficial quality in an employee.  I am sure you will too.
</p>

 
<p>In summation, Patrick is an exceptional candidate.  He has proven himself to be equipped with perseverance, intelligence, and natural talent. 
      I believe Patrick has the potential to accomplish great things, and I believe he would be a positive asset to any prospective employer. 
</p>

 
<p>If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me. Sincerely,
</p>
<p>Matthew Dawes, Chef/Owner; The Bull & Beggar; Executive Chef, The Admiral, Asheville NC</p>

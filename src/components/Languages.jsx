        <p className="languageText">At thirteen years old, I moved to Mexico after my house burnt down. My parents tried homeschooling me, but I ended up going to a regular middle school after just a few months. Even though it was a private school, only a couple of other students and the English teacher spoke fluent English.

I was thrown to the wolves, as they say, but ultimately, I benefited a ton by learning Spanish and the ins and outs of a completely different culture. I lived in Mexico from 13 to 18 years old, and to this day, I still keep up with my Spanish by talking to my friends in Mexico as well as many co-workers I've had. I feel like this experience not only taught me a new language but also gave me many other life skills. I know for a fact that I am a very adaptable person who can commit to learning something and will not give up until I do. I have a deep respect and hunger for acquiring knowledge. This is my story of why I speak Spanish!

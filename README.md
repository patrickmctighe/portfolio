Portfoilio Project
This is a website I made to host all of the diffrent aspects of my career and some other personal information that I feel best demonstrates my abilities.
I used React, Javascript, CSS, and HTML to make this project.
I had a great time making the CSS for this project. It should be compatible with most all devices used currently in 2024.
